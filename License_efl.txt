Licensing

EFL comes with several licences. Different shared libraries are
covered by different licenses, and are distributed here as an
aggregation with a single build system. Listed below are the library/project
names and the license file covering it. Note that this license would
cover all of the source invovled in each project (src/lib/PROJECT,
src/modules/PROJECT, src/bin/PROJECT data/PROJECT) unless specifically
noted otherwise (eg epp in edje or lz4, libunibreak etc.), so please
refer to these imported project sources for details (but be aware that
the licensing of such libraries is compatible with the libraries that
use them and is not more restrictive).

GPL if escape is used) due to license characteristics.
